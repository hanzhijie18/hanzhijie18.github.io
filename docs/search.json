Methodologically, he combines causal inference, text-as-data approaches, and large-scale elite biographical data, drawing on both qualitative institutional analysis and quantitative empirical strategies such as DID, RDD, and panel models.\nZhijie has conducted extensive research on Chinese political elites, including the construction and analysis of large-scale career databases. His recent projects also extend to digital governance and AI in social science, including the evaluation of LLM-generated silicon samples for political research.\nHis work has been presented at major international conferences, including the Midwest Political Science Association (MPSA) and the International Conference on Political Sociology, and published in peer-reviewed journals in political theory and political sociology. He is currently pursuing advanced training in political science and political economy at the London School of Economics and Political Science.\n\n\n\n2025 – Present: MSc in Political Science (Political Science & Political Economy), London School of Economics and Political Science\n2022 - 2025: M.Phil. in Marxist Theory, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, specializing in Chinese Communist Party History and Party Building\n2018 - 2022: B.A. in Management (Joint Honors Program in Politics, Law, and Sociology), Peking University, majoring in public administration"
