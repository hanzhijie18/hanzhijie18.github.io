::: {#hero-heading}

Zhijie Han is a political science researcher specializing in political economy, party and elite politics, and public administration, with a particular focus on Chinese governance and digital-state capacity.

His research examines how institutional design, cadre incentives, and digital governance tools shape political control, policy implementation, and fiscal and developmental outcomes. Methodologically, he combines causal inference, text-as-data approaches, and large-scale elite biographical data, drawing on both qualitative institutional analysis and quantitative empirical strategies such as DID, RDD, and panel models.

Zhijie has conducted extensive research on Chinese political elites, including the construction and analysis of large-scale career databases. His recent projects also extend to digital governance and AI in social science, including the evaluation of LLM-generated silicon samples for political research.

His work has been presented at major international conferences, including the Midwest Political Science Association (MPSA) and the International Conference on Political Sociology, and published in peer-reviewed journals in political theory and political sociology. He is currently pursuing advanced training in political science and political economy at the London School of Economics and Political Science.
